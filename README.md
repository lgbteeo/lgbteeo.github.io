# How to add your name
First, thank you. Ok, now...

Go to the [_data/supporters](https://github.com/lgbteeo/lgbteeo.github.io/tree/master/_data/supporters) folder.

Add a new file by clicking on the plus sign in the header and name it `[name].yml`.

In that file, you can include 4 data fields (just copy and paste):
```
name:
descriptor:
twitter:
link:
```
Then save the file (and choose the option to create a new branch) and submit your pull request.
