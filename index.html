      <h3>About this</h3>
        <p>Do people frequently ask you for help promoting a tech job? Or anything? Let's require some civil rights from the employers and events we help promote.</p>
        <p>Sign your name below and commit to asking employers if they allow LGBT discrimination before agreeing to help them promote anything.</p>
      <h3>Here's what to do</h3>
      <p>If someone asks you to help promote a job opening, event, or anything, you commit to ask...</p>
      <p>"Hey, before I promote your thing, I need to know:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Does your company include LGBT employees in its EEO nondiscrimination policy?</li>
        <li>Does your company offer benefits equally to LGBT employees, their partners, and their dependents? Including comprehensive medical care for Trans employees?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Thank you!"</p>

      <p><strong>When employers ask for my help recruiting, I commit to asking if their lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender employees are covered in their nondiscrimination policy and healthcare.</strong></p>
